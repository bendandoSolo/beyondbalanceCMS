    <fullWidthArea1Content><![CDATA[<p class="variable-padding">Did you know that approximately 90% of people who have an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) actually have Hashimoto’s? It’s likely that many people in fact have Hashimoto’s but don’t actually know because it is not commonly tested for on standard thyroid panels.</p>
<p class="variable-padding">Hashimoto’s is not a congenital problem with the thyroid gland itself but rather damage to the thyroid gland via the immune system which can lead to hypothyroidism.</p>
<p class="variable-padding">But did you know if Hashimoto’s is caught in time, it’s possible to halt the attack on the thyroid and prevent hypothyroidism and all the unpleasant symptoms that come with it?”</p>

      <column1TextArea1><![CDATA[<p class="two-column-layout text18">Hashimoto’s brought me to my knees in 2018 despite a healthier lifestyle than most. My hellish experience battling fatigue, anxiety, depression, cold Intolerance, dry skin, brittle hair, digestive issues, menstrual issues and poor sleep showed me that I could come out on top. Most importantly, I learned that the answer was not likely to be found in the form of a daily pill.</p>
<p class="two-column-layout text18">My journey started with me at an advantage having studied thyroid dysfunction while training to become a Nutritional Therapist. My journey was necessarily fuelled by multiple functional tests not found in GP practices (CBC, thyroid antibodies, stool test &amp; FST tests) to get to the root causes as well as continuous thyroid research.</p>
<p class="two-column-layout text18">Step by step, I discovered what I needed to eat (and avoid eating), how I needed to exercise (and avoid exercising), how my sleep patterns needed to change, what supplements I needed to take (and avoid taking), what I needed to do to heal my gut &amp; liver and how I needed to manage stress daily. I was able to calm my overactive immune system and heal my thyroid.</p>
<p class="two-column-layout text18">Now I dedicate my practice to the closely intertwined systems of the thyroid and the digestive system. Here’s to a healthy thyroid and a happy gut!</p>]]></column1TextArea1>

        <additionalText><![CDATA[I had been struggling with a knee injury for 6 months, which was not improving and i had got to the stage where it was even painful to walk. Georgia showed me various exercises to improve my strength and correct my muscle imbalances. After each week there was a noticeable difference, but i began running again prematurely and inevitably injured myself again. Georgia helped me get back to running injury free, without her training i don't think i would be running today]]></additionalText>

      <fullWidthArea1Content><![CDATA[<p>During this 6-week course we work through 6 modules to optimise thyroid health and reverse hypothyroid / Hashimoto's symptoms such as brain fog, fatigue, bloating, anxiety, cold intolerance, weight loss resistance and more.</p>
<p>The modules covered are:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="color: #009432 !important;">Module 1: BLOOD SUGAR + NERVOUS SYSTEM REGULATION</p>
<p style="color: #009432 !important;">Module 2: GUT HEALTH</p>
<p style="color: #009432 !important;">Module 3: LIVER HEALTH + REDUCING INFLAMMATION</p>
<p style="color: #009432 !important;">Module 4: ADRENAL-EMOTIONAL-BLOOD SUGAR CONNECTION</p>
<p style="color: #009432 !important;">Module 5: IMMUNE SYSTEM REGULATION</p>
<p style="color: #009432 !important;">Module 6: HOW TO INCREASE ANTIOXIDANTS VS PRO-OXIDANTS </p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are also options to have lab testing done in some of the modules if further digging is needed to find the root cause of the thyroid disorder.</p>
<p>The modules also cover what to eat including recipes for meals and snacks, supplements to take, ways to manage stress and huge insight into why your thyroid malfunctions and what we need to do to stop this from happening going forwards.</p>
<p>I hope you will enjoy the process of optimising your thyroid and overall health and every small win you have along the journey!</p>
