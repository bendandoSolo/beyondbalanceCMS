        <h2><b>Beyond Balance Privacy Policy</b></h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a purchase from <a href="http://beyondbalance.co.uk/">http://beyondbalance.co.uk/</a> (the “Site”).</p>
        <h3>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
        <p>When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”</p>
        <p>Additionally when you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase through the Site, we collect certain information from you, including your name, billing address, shipping address, payment information (including credit card numbers ), email address, and phone number.  We refer to this information as “Order Information.”</p>

        <p>When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or advertising relating to our products or services.</p>
        <p>We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).</p>
